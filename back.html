                    <p class="exercise-description">Every time I do this exercise, I imagine myself in a saddle boat speedrunning the Pacific Ocean. I can feel every muscle fiber and subatomic particle in my back. Absolute amazing mind-muscle connection. Next thing you know, I find myself lodged in the spacetime continuum, rowing to 1700 B.C. With each row, tremors occur along Pangea and goosebumps fill the native organisms. Entire ecosystems have been eradicated, and many species cease to exist. Back to modern day, anarchy ensues and the Purge begins. How lovely!</p>

My form was a bit off at first, right; I didn't really feel any engagement in my lats. But one day, I felt both of my wings just pulsate with a shockwave that covered my entire back. That was probably the most stimulating thing that has happened to me in the gym. That was the day my life changed. Since then, I've corrected my form, and I will continue to preach this exercise. I am currently salivating and drooling uncontrollably at the thought of doing this exercise.</p>

Plus, there are many different variations of this exercise mainly due to the various attachments you can use. This exercise really serves as the standard for the whole paradigm of back exercises.</p>

But anywho, I adore this exercise beyond comprehension; the amount of dropsets I do on this exercise is absurd. I don't know what it is about this exercise, but it keeps me hooked and practically addicted. I do this exercise with so much passion that I feel like a backwards cunt sometimes. I don't know what a backwards cunts is, but I've heard Conor McGregor say it as an insult before, and I thought it was quite comical.</p>

I have zero clue whether or not doing Lat Pulldowns with a close grip is effective or not in terms of muscular usage. But alas, the desire to do more Lat Pulldowns exceeds my care for that. I want to grow wings, do you understand? I want my Lats to triple the size of my torso. I want to be the next Buzz Lightyear. I also believe that doing Lat Pulldowns has turned me into sort of a lunatic I must say.</p>

Not only do you not have to wait for the Lat Pulldown, but this exercise may even be more effective. That is, if you can do a good amount of reps. However, you don't have to wait until you can Lat Pulldown your bodyweight before you can do Pull Ups. I currently Lat Pulldown 10 pounds less than my bodyweight for working weight, but I can still do approximately 12 good Pull Ups. I actually need to start integrating Pull Ups in my program.</p>

This caused a desire to perform this exercise, and so I did. It was rather sensational to say the least. Both lats felt like as if a porcupine had been shoved inside each. Although the experience was sensational, I actually prefer to perform a regular Lat Pulldown. Plot twist! Just like the cable lateral raise, this exercise takes double the time since it isolates the left and right sides. Plus, I can reach this level of sensation by just doing regular Lat Pulldowns. Granted, it won't be as scrumptious, but I don't mind.</p>

                    <p class="exercise-description">BOOOO. I have no desire to do this exercise. The exercise feels very uncomfortable and just maladroit. However, I will say that the movement actually feels pretty good due to the amount of freedom using the dumbbells. But everything else is wonky. Your body just doesn't feel right in that position. I feel like a straight bastard! Plus, my supporting arm gives out faster than I can finish the set, and I don't think my triceps are lacking at all. I think it's just the way I do the exercise. Maybe I'm the problem. I do think that the college experience has unleashed the demented version of myself into reality.</p>

I've always thought this was just an exercise for the Trapezius. But that doesn't matter. I wouldn't know, and I don't really care. This is a horrid exercise. I mean, who in the right mind does this exercise and thinks that this is enjoyable. At most, this exercise is just a modifed Shrug. Therefore, this exercise should be at most a whatever. Also, this exercise is supposedly detrimental to your shoulder joints. I would believe them. Considering how unsatisfying this exercise is, I would assume that doing this exercise will cause your shoulders to go kablooey immediately.</p>

I swear that machine looked scrumptious. I would go haywire on that machine and do unspeakable things. My lats would become so massive, and I would be able to soar the skies.</p>
