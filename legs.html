During the exercise, all the of evils escape my body as I experience pain like none other. But I never fear, for Calypso and her succulents are here. After the exercise, I gaze upon the stars with Calypso holding me endearingly, teaching me of the constellations. The feeling dissipates, and I'm suddenly alone again. Wouldn't it be nice to be loved and held?</p>

                    <p class="exercise-description">As I set my tree trunks in place, I get my rocket thrusters ready. My seismic shakers are now planted, and my pistons have never been this fired up. Every time I go down, I feel like I am submerged within the Earth's core. But my nuclearly explosive fuel drives me straight to outer space, where I get to momentarily raid a space station and fondle with the Ozone layer. Once I land back on planet Earth, I find myself on the Sentinel Islands. Bewildered, I frolic around and eventually encounter the native tribes. I soon become leader of them at the sight of my massive quads, an indication of power.</p>

                    <p class="exercise-name">Barbell Squat</p>
                    <p class="exercise-description">As Tom Platz would say, "There's nothing like squats". I wholly agree, but I prefer a Pendulum or Hack Squat for more stabilization. Or maybe I'm just a lazy bum. Also, my form is probably not too good. Also also, I could never get the bar to rest on my traps very well; my arms just don't bend backward like that. I am actually built terribly wrong. But that's okay. It's okay Kevin. Finally, I had my most embarrassing gym moment with this exercise. The first time I did legs, I was squatting 135 and my form was absolutely abhorrent. Every time I would go up, I would sort of lean forward and my balance was nothing but garbage. During a rep, I failed to correct my balance and I fell forward. Luckily, there were safety bars, but good lord it was loud. So, I believe I have been mortified of Barbell Squats since then.</p>

                    <p class="exercise-description">I remember the first time doing this exercise. Although I didn't feel much on that day, I will never forget how sore my hamstrings were the day after. Every step and any leg movement caused a ripple of excruciating pain through each and every fiber in the back side of my thighs. In other words, this is the absolute best exercise for hamstrings, and I will continue to destroy them with this exercise. Every time I do this exercise, I squeal with excitement, howling at my mirror image as urine dribbles down my legs. Sorry, I have trouble controlling my bladder when I get to do something so intoxicating and exhilarating.</p>

But that's besides the point. I'll do so many drop sets of this exercise and go to failure consecutively. The aching pain afterward is so unbearable that I curl into a fetal position. I love the feeling of not being able to walk. Sometimes my legs will tremble as I near failure. But I will continue to do drop set after drop set. My convulsing body is no longer functioning properly. Shaking and quivering, I fall off the machine and patiently wait for the paramedics.</p>

It gets even more fun when you go beyond failure. The voices in my head tell me to do one more rep, and I cave in. As my legs tremor under the weight, I let out a guttural wail to the gods. I managed to finish the rep, but at what cost? I lie there, a deformed husk of a broken man. In my eyes, I am in some sort of mental asylum, unable to move due to the straitjacket put on me. It's as if I have become bedridden for the rest of my life.</p>

                    <p class="exercise-description">In my personal experience, this exercise hits the calves the best. You want to place the balls of your feet at the very bottom of the platform and then simply use your calves to move the platform. Make sure each rep is slow and controlled. This way, you will feel your calves more and their slow but sure annihilation. Afterward, you can just simply rest there and temporarily become someone's memaw, eating your apple custard pie. How delicious!</p>

Ultimately, Romanian Deadlifts are far superior for muscle growth and hypertrophy, whereas Deadlifts are for powerlifters who can rep 5x their bodyweight for no reason. I don't have much to say about this exercise, but I have a lot of respect for it. It's just not an exercise I enjoy since I can simply destroy my back completely with my terrible form.</p>

This also gets my glutes very very sore. However, I feel like a neanderthal after doing 2 or more sets of this exercise the way my mind is blank and my body is deprived of oxygen after enduring the most excruciating pain from the most nefarious exercise to exist. I will be needing weekly PTSD therapy sessions if I continue to do this exercise.</p>

                    <p class="exercise-description">So I do legs twice a week. One day is more hamstring focused while the other is more quadricep focused. However, this exercise manages to be in both. It isn't as efficient as Romanian Deadlifts, but it still gets the job done. Plus, this exercise is much less tiring. Just like the Leg Extension, the Leg Curl is really the only isolated hamstring exercise. However, the Leg Curl has two variants; one is lying, and the other is seated. I'd say that the lying version is superior; it just feels higher quality, and it has a better range of motion.</p>

So while we're here, let's talk about Frank Ocean. I think I've listened to too much of his music. So much that my neurons no longer fire correctly. But it's okay. Every time I listen to White Ferrari, some of my sanity seems to coalesce again. Frank Ocean's music keeps me from vanishing into thin air. Needless to say, Frank Ocean save my life.</p>

Therefore, these scratches stack on each other, and it dissuades me from continuing to do this exercise. I guess my calves are just too powerful for my body to handle, but they sure don't look like anything too great.</p>

However, maybe their arms are also not capable of regular functionality, such as bending backwards enough to hold the bar and place it on their traps. But still, I believe Hack Squats or Pendulum Squats are just so much easier and better and wonderful and mesmerizing and marvelous than any type of squat that uses a barbell. If my opinion offends you, that is okay. You may beat me to a bloody pulp because I honestly need some sort of beating due to how much time I waste.</p>
