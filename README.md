### A website that contains my personal experiences while lifting weights it the gym.
---
This is my first project and uses the 3 basic technologies of web development: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Although my code is messy and the journey was a bit haphazard, I learned a lot from this and will actually retain the knowledge.
I thought this was an appropiate time to make a project and an original one too rather than continuing with tutorial hell and forgetting everything.
