                    <p class="exercise-description">The greatest chest exercise of all time due to its full range of motion. Plus, you don't really get shoulder pain from this as frequent as the barbell bench press. It feels like I'm pushing all the demons away from my life. All my stress and worries are pushed into the future. This is called procrastinating. Anyways, as I near failure, my eyeballs start bulging and my arms start trembling; what a fantastic exercise.</p>

I will admit that this geniunely burns and absolutely saps all the energy out of me, but the tingling and agonizing sensation is truly immaculate. Your chest feels like it grew ten sizes and everything you do with a chest pump just feels more exquisite.</p>

                    <p class="exercise-description">The most classic exercise and a cornerstone to all of weightlifting. This was actually the very first exercise I've ever done in a gym, and the amount on instability and trembling in my arms was unreal. It felt like a magnitude 17 earthquake formed within my body, causing a tremor to proliferate to every single bone and cell in my biological system. Since then, I have a polished my form into something wonderful, but I really only do Dumbbell Bench Press now since open bench racks are getting more and more rare.</p>

Pretty much all benching exercises that use barbells can be replaced with dumbbells and I do just that. I don't really believe that one is better than the other as long as you train just as intense. Although, I will note that using dumbbells will give you more range of motion and balance.</p>

This primarily revolves around the machine itself, but there are times where your body just needs the optimal conditions to perform. But for the most part, I train the upper chest with dumbbells, so this is not much of a worry.</p>

On a real note, this exercise only feels a little worse than the machine version; it is still a decent exercise.</p>

However, if not warmed up properly or for whatever reasons, my shoulders and clavicles will hurt as if the bone has developed natural thorns and ripped apart the surrounding internal flesh. Also, my hand and wrists will hurt more often than my clavicles just because I'm putting my bodyweight on those joints. Then, my palm will start to itch where it was placed on the handles, and it's all just a little annoying and bothersome for me just to do this exercise. However, after all of this, I still do dips regularly, and I'll do more of them on the days that these dumb excuses are not as prevalent.</p>

To be frank, I want to do this exercise more, and I don't know why I don't. I literally have access to do this exercise, but I guess my routine is so set in place that I cannot physically control what I do in the gym anymore.

                    <p class="exercise-description">To be frank, I don't do a whole lot of chest exercises that involve cables. The first reason is that I'm using two cables which is pretty much like taking up two parking spots for one car. I try to think of others you know. I kind of feel bad since I pretty much deny someone from using the cable even though this exercise can easily be replaced by the chest fly machine. Another reason why I don't particularly like this exercise is that it is a little bit hard to set up especially if the cables are far apart. </p>

It also feels quite unstable, and you have to position your body so that you don't fly off and get ripped in half by the cables. Or you could let go of the cables. But don't get me wrong though, this is a banger of an exercise if you know how to do it properly. I unfortunately do not know how to peform this exercise very well, and I don't have much desire to do so.</p>

It just drastically limits the range of motion while activating the same muscles as a typical bench press. Some might say that this targets more of the inner chest, but I don't really think that matters. As long as you train chest well, your entire pectoral muscles should develop.</p>
