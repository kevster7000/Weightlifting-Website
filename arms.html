Have you stuffed your stomach so full that you deteriorated? Well, other than the last one, my arteries have experienced this stuffing mechanism before by pumping so much blood into my biceps. Almost every time that I use this machine, I make my arteries work overtime. Blood courses into my biceps, and they start throbbing, almost as if they are ready to blow up. What an appalling masterpiece!</p>

My triceps have never been that sore, and I felt regions that I didn't even know existed. My triceps felt like a roasted chicken over a bonfire consisting of magma and hydrochloric acid. This is the tricep exercise that I crave the most. This exercise has basically become a mantra, a desire, and an obsession that gnaws at the tattered edges of my sanity.</p>

But only to see if my form is exquisite, not to inflate my ego by looking at my massive triceps or should I say horseshoes. Croissants, even. I can't even see them because I never wear tank tops or stringers to the gym. I don't even own any. But when I lift those sleeves. As I unveil those massive and tremendous triceps from their covers, oh boy do I get satiated.</p>

                    <p class="exercise-description">I've only recently started to incorporate forearms in my workouts. Every variant of the wrist curl just feels awkward. But this exercise is utter perfection. I just know that this exercise will grow on me and climb the rankings. I have never felt such forearm activation. Losing the ability to bend your wrists is okay since the feeling of soreness in your forearm is nothing but sheer satisfaction. Sometimes my forearms feel like they have been blown to shreds by an IED or have been obliterated by a Remington shotgun. Terrific!</p>

The main reason is the grip and holding the extension itself. My hands don't like that texture and being squished into the end caps. Also, by the time I hit failure, my triceps don't feel as juiced as they should. Maybe I just do this exercise completely wrong, but that's unlikely. Who knows? It is possible though. Maybe I do deserve to be isolated from the world. But I am already. How fun! It's just me and my voices.</p>

How delectable they are! What a change in perspective. What an experience! That day, I said goodbye to Hammer Curls forever and developed a manic infatuation with Reverse Curls. There is no going back; I have simply evolved and undergone an irreversible transition.</p>

Maybe that's why my biceps are lacking. Or maybe I just don't train hard enough. Or maybe I just don't like doing biceps that much.

But, I don't use grips or straps, so that inherently trains this muscle when performing other exercises that require some grip strength.</p>
