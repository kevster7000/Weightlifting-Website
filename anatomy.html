                <h2>Anatomy of the Chest</h2><br>
                <p>The chest consists of two pectoral muscles, Pectoralis Major and Pectoralis Minor. Both of which are mainly activated during pushing or pressing movements. These muscles can be broken down into three regions: the Clavicular, Sternal, and Costal heads. In the figure below, you can why these heads were given their names. The Clavicular head connects the Humerus (the bone between the elbow and shoulder) to the Clavicle (collar bone). The Sternal head connects the Humerus to the Sternum. And the Costal head connects the Humerus to the Costal Cartilages of the ribs.</p>

                <p>As mentioned, the main movements that activate the pectoral muscles are pressing or pushing movements such as the bench press. Another common movement that activates the chest is the fly, where you squeeze the chest from an elongated postion to a closed position. This movement is usually done with a machine, an exercise known as the machine fly or pec deck. </p>
                <br>
                <p>For all of these movements, the Sternal Head is typically the most used since it is the largest and middle-most muscle of the chest. However, we can target the regions of the chest by changing the angle from which we press or fly. The Sternal Head is targeted by pressing with your arms roughly perpendicular to the body. For pushing movements, the bench should be flat, or set to 0 degrees so that the path of the press works directly against gravity, meaning the path is perpendicular to the ground. For flying movements, the same pretty much applies except for you are sitting up instead of laying down - keep your arms perpendicular to the body and squeeze them together around the same angle along the path.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The Clavicular Head is usually targeted by pressing at a higher angle. This is done by adjusting the bench from anywhere between 15 and 45 degrees, with the ideal angle being 30 degrees. Although the path should still work directly against gravity, your body is tilted. And due to this angle, you are no longer pressing perpendicular do your body, which causes more emphasis on the Clavicular Head. Targeting the Clavicular head with flying movements is a little bit tricker. Instead of maintaining your arms perpendicular to your body, your arms need to move from a lower angle to a higher angle as you perform the exercise. Therefore, cables are typically used for this exercise rather than machines since machines have fixed handles. This exercise is known as Low to High Cable Crossover, or simply Low Cable Crossover.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The Costal Head is known as the most lower portion of the chest. Oftentimes, it is never targeted specifically because it is also used alongside Sternal Head movements. Additionally, it is not as impressive visibly or physically as the other parts of the chest. Instead, people try to develop their Clavicular Head more since it makes the chest look more round and full. An overdeveloped Costal Head will make the chest look a bit saggy. However, there are still many movements that emphasize the Costal Head. For pushing movements, the bench is adjusted to a negative angle, which is typically -15 or -10 degrees. Once again, the path is still going to be perpendicular to the ground, but the angle from which you press is not going to be perpendicular to your body due to the change of angle. Additionally, you can target the Costal Head with flying movements. When trying to target the Clavicular Head, the movement goes from a lower angle to a higher angle. For the Costal Head, it is simply the opposite - high to low. This exercise is known as the High Cable Crossover.</p>

                <h2>Anatomy of the Shoulders</h2><br>
                <p>Each shoulder is made up of one primary muscle called the Deltoid. It is a very versatile muscle group due to the various movements of the arm. From here, the Deltoid can be separated in to three regions: the Front Deltoid, Lateral Deltoid, and Rear Deltoid. In the figure below, the yellow region represents the Front Deltoid, the red region represents the Lateral Deltoid, and the purple region represents the Rear Deltoid. It should be noted that it is near impossible to target a single region of the Deltoid. Every shoulder execise will try to target a specific region, but since the Deltoid is a relatively small muscle, it will also utilize the surrounding regions of the targeted region.</p>

                <p>Most shoulder exercises can be classified into three movement groups: the press, raise, and fly, which target the Front, Lateral, and Rear Deltoid respectively.

                <h2>Anatomy of the Back</h2><br>
                <p>The back consists of many layers, each with many different muscles. When talking about bodybuilding, we primarily only care about the most superficial muscles since they are most visible muscles of our back.</p>

                <h2>Anatomy of the Arms</h2><br>
                <p>Each arm can be broken down into 3 muscle groups: the bicep, tricep, and forearm. However, the forearm is often neglected. </p>
